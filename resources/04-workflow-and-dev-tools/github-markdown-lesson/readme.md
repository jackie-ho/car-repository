## Information (10 min)

Github provides an easy way to show users information about what is in your repo through the use of readme files. When the user visits your repo, they see a nicely formatted html page that can include any information you want, including feature highlights, screenshots, version info, known bugs, directions for use, etc. You simply need to have a file named `readme.md` in the root of your repo to have the page automatically shown.

In the file, you simply need to write the Github markdown, or a special syntax, to display your content. The markdown is translated into HTML for you, but is simpler to write. You can actually write HTML in your file, but only a subset of full HTML is supported. A cheatsheet is linked below showing the most common markdown uses. Also included is a plugin that can be used with Android Studio which shows a preview of the readme as you're writing it. Be careful, this preview isn't 100% accurate, but gives a decent idea.

It is always a good idea to include readme files with your git repos simply to help anyone looking at your files in the future.
