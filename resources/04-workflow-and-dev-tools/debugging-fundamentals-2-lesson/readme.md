## Independent Practice: Bug Fixing (10 minutes)

You have been provided [a simple calculator](starter-code). Given that the user enters two numbers, a result is shown when the user pressed one of the operation buttons.

However, it is broken. Sometimes, it crashes and some of the buttons behave unexpectedly.

Clone the [provided sample code](starter-code), import the project into Android Studio, and fix as many bugs as possible using the help of breakpoints and the stack traces.

If you do not understand what a stack trace's message is telling you, try googling it to see if someone else has encountered a similar issue.
